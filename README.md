json-ish implementation of osm data model


### but why?

...if want to render some nodes, lines, polygons that happen to be related iin the browser let's use just 1 request to send it all over...

### imagined use cases

...bus route with stop signs, street-level-imagery data with sequence made of nodes, osm data :)
